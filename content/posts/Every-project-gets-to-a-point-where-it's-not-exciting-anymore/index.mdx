Yes! we have always come across this point where, a project becomes so boring that it doesn't excite you anymore. There is not enough excitement which you had at the beginning of that project. Trust me I have been in that situation. In my freelancing journey I came across many projects, that would excite me at the beginning but over the time it becomes so boring and that excitement fades away, it just feels like a work we need to get rid off.

Few days earlier I stumbled upon a video on youtube by Big Think. That video stunned me, that there appears to be a part of our brain called the ventral striatum, that's the technical term, or you also could call it the seeking system. And this system is urging us to explore the boundaries of what we know. It's urging us to be curious. And, by the way, I mean innately. I mean children six months old, three months old. If you give them some toy they love it for a little while. As they get used to it, your car keys become more interesting. It's the new and it's the desire to learn. And evolutionary this system was developed to help us, to keep us learning. When I learned about this seeking system it really turned me on because it started to give me an insight into why disengagement from boring work, that may not be a bug. That might be a feature.

Now stressing on the last sentence, imagine the problem as an opportunity to grow and focus on the outcomes that are related to project whether they are intrinsic or not but imagine how satisfying is that feeling when you complete that project which you were about to give up. And after that particular project backtrack the things which made you feel boring, in my case tech stack was the reason i felt boring because I was using the same tech stack for previous project too. So I upskilled myself to learning different frameworks and experiment with them. So this was my take on tackling boredom during project. What is yours?
