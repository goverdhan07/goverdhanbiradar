Starting from the basics :) <br />
Apache Kafka is a Distributed Stream Processing Software/System developed by LinkedIn and it is written in Scala and Java.

The first key component of kafka is Kafka server or kafka broker, this is the initial server with which users interact with.
It has resemblance with other servers for example it listens to some TCP connection and accepts some connection.

As we can see in the above diagram, it consists of two Abstractions, called `Producers` and `Consumers`. Yes! as the name suggests Producers mainly produce and publishes the content
to `Broker` and then Consumer consumes the content. <br />

And in the middle we have Kafka Broker, this is where all the magic happens, it has a default port `9092`. The other abstraction in kafka is escentially the connection
to connect with each other using a TCP connection. Thats a raw TCP connection so its a bi-direction which simply means producer can communicate with broker and broker can communicate back with producer hence, vice - versa 
this similar TCP connection is present between broker and consumer too.

Kafka Broker, this consists of `Topics`, Topics are nothing but the systematic logs which keep records of all the entries into a partition. Kafka broker can have many topics!
Producer sends continuous streams of messages to broker mentioning topic and if the consumer is interested in a particular message then the Consumer will reach out to the
particular topic and particular partition. <br />

This is somewhat an overall picture of how Kafka works. Seems easy? Now, lets complicate a bit! <br />

Lets look into an example: As mentioned earlier kafka consists Producer, Consumer and Broker. But in this case, Broker consists of a topic called users. 
Now, producer wants to publish a string  "Gov" to Users topic, Broker validates the message and logs an entry of the string in the topic. Then again if producer wants to send another message then
the new message would be stored in the next block in a sequential order. 

Kafka borrowed the concept of data Shrading where the data is divided into parts called partitions and the data inside the partition fetched with the topic name and partition key.

There's another important abstraction of Kafka called `Consumer group`.
Consumer Groups were mainly built for parallel processing when the system scales. Here, Partitions are allocated to a group of consumers as show above. Where in, that particular group of consumer is responsible for subsribing to the messages in that partitions.
