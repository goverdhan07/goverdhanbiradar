Many of my teammates in my agency use GitHub for lot of things. For me it is not only something that version controls my side projects but a lot more than that.

GitHub provides one user page and unlimited project pages. You can use the user/organization page to host a website (for example you can simply host your portfolio). You can push the code to GitHub and make your website live with version control. GitHub also supports [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) .

```Just a tip if you are a beginner, then try to use more of command line and less of GitHub GUI. This will make you learn some Git.```

**Push your side projects on GitHub:** If the repository is public people will contribute to your code and then with collaborate coding you can turn your minor side project into an awesome project which is being used by people. That feeling of people contributing to YOUR project with their skillset is amazing.

Contribute to other open source projects. GitHub has a very nice way of making people learn to give credits to someone's code if they are using it. Learn those etiquette.

**Wondering what are open source projects? or How to contribute?**

Ans:

```Just participate in Hacktober fest which is organised every year in the month of october. This fest was initiated with the idea of increasing and improving contribution towards open source. Read more about it here: [HactoberFest](hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) or just ping me I will help you. :)```

Also, you can even use GitHub to have a list of books that you want to read, a list of anything actually. I have many like that. Markdown makes things very easy and clean. Do not think much on what you should put on GitHub and what not. If it is something bad, no one will look at that and I don't think anyone can be that judgmental that they can look at one code file of yours and decide that you don't write clean code. So just go ahead and push whatever you feel like, without worrying about anything.

Start cool projects or lists. Follow people you feel you can learn something from their activity and if you want to use GitHub as a social network. Learn to add readme and different types of licenses.

Just read an wonderful blog on how to write an effective readme By Darsh Shah: [here](https://iamdarshshah.hashnode.dev/how-to-add-your-recently-published-articles-to-your-github-profile-readme-using-github-actions)

Atlast, Show some love just by upvoting this blog and also Darsh Shah's Blog. It just gives a little hit of dopamine in the brain and also encourages us to write more.
