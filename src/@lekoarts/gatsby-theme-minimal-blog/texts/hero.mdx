I *werk* around Backend. Currently Dangling with Microservices at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-in/) (Contract Basis) as Engineer III.<br />
I like watching space tech, building Game Environments using [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) (I am bad at it), and walking through the random places on Internet and trust me I know the darkest corners of internet :)  <br /><br />

In this portfolio, you will find my Projects, Blog, and all the things that I want to *Brag* about.
